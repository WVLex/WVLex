Hi, I’m Alexey Markin
I write my projects only on Python language, but now I feel, what I should learn something else, more low-level and more diffirent, than Python.
And all of this because I'm really interest about computer scince. I'm really want to know, how one or other technology works.
Big part of my projects - Telegram Bots. But I also work with django, flask, different api, like spotify or YooMoney.
